# About

Allows to use Maven backed by AWS CodeArtifact repository in GitHub Actions:
1. Setup Java + Maven
2. Authorize in AWS Account with a provided role
3. Generate CodeArtifact token and URL and put in env variables
4. Compose `settings.xml` and put in a place where Maven can find it

Designed to be used in your build workflow when you need to access packages from CodeArtifact.
It is also used in publish workflow to upload packages in CodeArtifact.
For release workflow you likely want to bump a version in `pom.xml` file and add some git tags,
so please check the [agilecustoms/publish](https://github.com/agilecustoms/publish) action â€”
it represents a holistic release action (uses `setup-maven-codeartifact` under the hood).

For build and publish workflows it is recommended to use different IAM roles: `/ci/builder` and `/ci/publisher`.
Below there are two terraform modules that have all necessary permissions to work with CodeArtifact:
- [ci-builder](https://github.com/agilecustoms/terraform-aws-ci-builder)
- [ci-publisher](https://github.com/agilecustoms/terraform-aws-ci-publisher)

And this is [example](https://github.com/agilecustoms/terraform-aws-ci-publisher?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-create-a-role-with-this-policy)
how to create AWS IAM role based of these policies with password-less trust policy

This action is a combination of few other actions mainly `actions/setup-java` and `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`,
hence all parameters have prefix either `java-` (for java-specific settings) or `aws-` (for authorization in aws)

## Usage in build workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  Build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write # to request JWT from GitHub OIDC provider
      contents: read # required for actions/checkout
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Java
        uses: agilecustoms/setup-maven-codeartifact@v1
        with:
          aws-account: ${{ vars.AWS_ACCOUNT_DIST }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
          aws-role: ci/builder # default 
          aws-codeartifact-domain: mycompany
          java-version: 21 # default

      - name: Maven build
        run: mvn verify --no-transfer-progress
```

## settings.xml for local development

Under the hood, this action generates [settings.xml](./ci.settings.xml) file with CodeArtifact repository and credentials.
Note:
- maven central and its mirror are used as primary repositories for dependencies and plugins, your company CodeArtifact is in 3rd place
- your company repository id has format `{aws-codeartifact-domain}-{aws-codeartifact-repository}`

With this knowledge, you can place a local version of [settings.xml](./local.settings.xml) on developers' machines
to give them read-only access to maven packages in corporate CodeArtifact.
As you can see this `settings.xml` file has two env variables: `ARTIFACT_STORE_HOST` and `ARTIFACT_STORE_TOKEN`.
Host is fixed (after you create CodeArtifact domain), you can place these two lines in your shell configuration (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`):
```shell
export AWS_ACCOUNT_DIST=123456789012
export ARTIFACT_STORE_HOST="mycompany-$AWS_ACCOUNT_DIST.d.codeartifact.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
```
For `ARTIFACT_STORE_TOKEN` you'd need to generate it (at most) once a day with command like this:
```shell
TOKEN=$(aws codeartifact get-authorization-token --domain mycompany --query authorizationToken --output text)
export ARTIFACT_STORE_TOKEN=$TOKEN
```
